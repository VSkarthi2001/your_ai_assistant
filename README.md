# about the application

This project develops an AI-powered personal assistant using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, designed to act according to user preferences. The assistant does not perform document analysis but adapts its functionality based on the user-crafted system prompt, enhancing productivity and providing tailored solutions for personal use. It offers context-aware responses and assists with project organization, content creation, and decision-making. By streamlining workflows and aligning with individual needs, it ensures improved efficiency and a highly personalized user experience.
